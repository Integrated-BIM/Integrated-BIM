## Semantic Versioning for Public Releases
Reference: https://semver.org/

1-Major Version (X.0.0):
1.	For desktop apps, this could mean major UI redesign, changes in core functionalities, or any alteration that would require users to adapt to new usage patterns.
2-Minor Version (X.Y.0):
1.	For desktop apps, this could involve adding new modules, improving existing features, or enhancing the user experience without breaking existing functionalities.
3-Patch Version (X.Y.Z):
1.	For desktop apps, this typically involves fixing bugs, addressing performance issues, or making small adjustments that don't introduce new features but improve the stability and reliability of the software.

For example, let's say you're developing a desktop app called "MyApp" with an initial version of 1.0.0. Here's how you might increment versions as you make changes:
1.	You add a new feature that doesn't break existing functionality: 1.1.0
2.	You fix a bug in the 1.1.0 release: 1.1.1
3.	You add a major feature that requires users to adapt: 2.0.0
4.	You fix a critical bug in the 2.0.0 release: 2.0.1







## Semantic Versioning for Internal Releases

Pre-release Identifiers: These are added after the version number to indicate that the version is not yet stable or publicly released. Pre-release identifiers are appended with a hyphen (-). For example, if the current version is 1.0.0, internal releases might look like 1.0.0-alpha, 1.0.0-beta, or 1.0.0-rc1.
Example Workflow
1.	Initial Development:
o	First internal release: 1.0.0-alpha
o	Subsequent internal releases: 1.0.0-alpha.1, 1.0.0-alpha.2, ...
2.	Beta Testing:
o	First beta release: 1.0.0-beta
o	Subsequent beta releases: 1.0.0-beta.1, 1.0.0-beta.2, ...
3.	Release Candidate:
o	First release candidate: 1.0.0-rc.1
o	Subsequent release candidates: 1.0.0-rc.2, 1.0.0-rc.3, ...
